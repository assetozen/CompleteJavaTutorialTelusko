Prototype design pattern
    - example:- creating an object from DB takes time so lets say we have created the first object from the DB
            - planning to create second object from the already crated object instead of going to DB
                    - this is called prototype design pattern
                            - it simply clones the already created object
                                - something like cloning or copying the first object
