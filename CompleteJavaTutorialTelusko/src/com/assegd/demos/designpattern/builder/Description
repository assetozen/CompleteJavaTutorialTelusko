Builder patter
- simplifies funtionality
- for this example case
    - we have created a phonBuilder class
        - it has setters for all the phone object properties
        - when createing the phone object
            - not necessary to put all properties
            - u can only pass the property values u want
            - no sequence is needed
        - in shop class we are creating phone object and assinging all the properties using
        the phoneBuilder instance
