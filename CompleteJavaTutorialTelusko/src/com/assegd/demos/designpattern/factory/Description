- In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation
logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

- Example
        - we create and interface of Shape
                - we create Shape classes implementing the Shape interface (classes like:- circle, rectangle, triangle)
        - we create a shapeFactory class which has getShape method which accepts string shapeType(can be cirle, rectangle...)
                - we decide which shape object to return by comparing the shape type we pass
        - we create demo(with main method) to implement our logic
                - we create object of shapeFactory
                -we create as an exmple object of Circle using Shape(interface)
                        Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("Circle")
                        shape1.draw() -> will say that it is draw from cirle class
