- Composite object - has a tree structure
                   - can have composite and leaf objects inside it

- is part of structural design pattern
- used when we want to have an object which wants to represent a tree structure
            Example: Assembling a computer
                    computer                                        [composite object]
                            - cabinet                               [composite object]
                                    - hard disk                     [Leaf object :- doesn't have anything in side it(it is the last object)]
                                    - motherboard                   [composite object]
                                            - RAM                       [Leaf object :- doesn't have anything in side it(it is the last object)]
                                            - CPU                       [Leaf object :- doesn't have anything in side it(it is the last object)]
                            - peripheral devices                    [composite object]
                                    - mouse                             [Leaf object :- doesn't have anything in side it(it is the last object)]
                                    - keyboard                          [Leaf object :- doesn't have anything in side it(it is the last object)]
