----------------------- Java 9 Features ------------------------
Java 9 features are very different from earlier versions.

1:--- We have Jigsaw project (Modularity) in Java 9.
Jigsaw was planned to release in 2008 then 2014 but due to some reasons it got delayed.
Now Jigsaw is here in Java 9 with its powerful feature.
It provides a modularity feature

2:--- Second amazing feature of Java 9 is REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) with the help of JShell
        - install jdk, set ur environment variable
        -open cmd and check java -version
                - to get in to jshell write -> jshell
                        - you can write any code you want and see the result right away
                            - 1+1 -> will print $1 ==> 2
                            - u can use $1 as a variable for further use
                            - u can create variables:- int a = 5
                            - u can set feedback by changing the type of feedback
                                -> /set feedback verbote
                           - now lets create a variable -> int k = 1;
                                -> output will be -> k==>2
                                                    | created variable k : int
                        - semi colon is not a must to add for a single line code but for multiple lines
                        - to see all the commands u have used so far "/list"
                                -> will display all the commands with their id number
                        - if you want to edit one of the commands, then u can access them via their id number
                                -> /edit  id_num
                                        -> will open editor with the part that u wanna edit, simple do ur changes and accpet and exit
                                -> now if you check the list again then u will see the changes u made

                        - single and doubble tabs, after writing anything Eg:- String
                                ->Single tab:- will give u suggessions
                                ->double tab(clicking tab afer see the suggessions):- will give u documentations
                        - /vars :- will show u the variables u have created
                        - /methods:- will show u the methods u have created so far
                        - /history :- will display everything u wrote before this command as history
                        - /imports :- will show all the packages imported
                        - shortcut to import any library
                                -> Write the name of the lib you want to import
                                    ->press SHIFT+TAb then 'i'
                                            -> example:- JFrame - then SHIFT+TAB then i
                                                    - choose 0 do nothing or 1 import
                         - /save file
                         - /open file
                                - in a directory you can open any class
