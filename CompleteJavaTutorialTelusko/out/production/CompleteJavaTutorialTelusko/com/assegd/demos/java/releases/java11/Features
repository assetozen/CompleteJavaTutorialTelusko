---------------------- Java 11 Features -------------------------
selected by me

1. running classes from cmd
            - earlier
                    javac -d classes HelloWorld.java
                    java -cp classes HelloWorld
            - now  -> no need to compile
                    java HelloWorld.java
2. Http Client
    - HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 and websockets
    - both synchronous and asynchronous programming models
    - handles request and response bodies as reactive-streams
    - follows the familiar builder pattern
3. TLS 1.3
        - security
4. Java Flight Recorder
    - collecting and recording data in the JVM runtime
    - it allows you to catch errors that are diffuclt to catch in development time
5. ZGC (Predictable, low latency, large heap GC)
    - multi tera byte heaps
    - Max GC pause time (10ms)
    - Max application throughput reduction 15%
    - it is enabled with
            -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions-XX:+UseZGC
6. Create Variables using local-variable type inference
        From -> ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        To   -> var outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
7. Create lambda expression with type inferred local-variables as lambda parameters
    - lambda expressions could be explicitly typed:
        (Item x, int y) -> x.process(y);
    - lambda expressions could be implicitly typed:
        ( x, y) -> x.process(y);
    - Now lambda expressions can also be implicitly typed with the var syntax:
        (var x, var y) -> x.process(y);
    - only limitation you can not mix var and non-var in implicitly and explicitly typed lambda expressions
        (var x, y) -> x.process(y);   ---->>> implicityl typed
        (var x, var y) -> x.process(y); -----> explicitly
